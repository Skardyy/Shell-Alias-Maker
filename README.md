## CLI goals  
* open apps by having a folder of shortcuts to those apps -> done
* have a file called aliases.txt to alias to those apps -> done
* have shortcut command, like fzf-cd, fzf-edit, etc.. -> sort of, midway
* have install commands (this will be baked in) for installing stuff like fzf and more needed things later
* let normal terminal commands through -> done
