## CLI goals  
* <font color='green'>open apps by having a folder of shortcuts to those apps</font>  
* <font color='green'>have a file called aliases.txt to alias to those apps</font>  
* <font color='green'>have aliases for terminal commands</font>  
* <font color='green'>let normal terminal commands through</font>  
* <font color='red'>create a way to make commands that install dependencies and git projects</font>  
## Usage  
* download cc.exe from [latest release](https://github.com/Skardyy/cc/releases/latest).  
* add the dir that contains cc.exe into your path env variable.  
* open your terminal, write cc, and you're done.  
### Important  
the shortcuts folder that contains the .lnk files and aliases.txt file must be at the same dir as cc.exe  
## to-know  
* because cc is an unsigned executable and runs commands, if the command or app you're running is unknown cc will be flagged as antivirus, in such case u can exclude it from the scan of antivirus (or just don't run shady apps / commands), but do so in cautions
